## ServoRun

### Automatic cup dispenser on coin acceptance
Arduino recieves input from coin acceptor and initiates a servo rotation of 90 degrees and back.
The servo is connected to a star attachment with a metal rod on one of the star points. The metal rod is attached to a Button on a plastic cup dispenser.
On recieving a 1 Ruppee coin, the machine spits out one cup onto a holder. The machine is tamper proof.

## WaterQualityProject

### Output PH and TDS values to a screen

PH, TDS, Water Level, and temperature sensors attached to an Arduino sending Serial output to a Raspberry Pi Zero which is running a Python program using Tkinter to display the sensor readings. The Arduino and sensor controller boards are housed in a 5'x7'x3' plastic box. The Raspberry Pi is housed in a small plastic box. All wires are soldered and sheathed.
